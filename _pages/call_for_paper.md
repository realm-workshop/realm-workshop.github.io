- **Planning, Reasoning, and Decision-Making:** Mechanisms and models that empower LLM agents to make plans, reason, backtrack, and take independent decisions in dynamic environments.
- **Agent Quality Evaluation:** Methodologies to assess the agent performance and to guide their improvement.
- **Data and simulation environments:** Data architectures, datasets and simulated environments for building LLM agents.
- **Agent-optimized LLMs:** Training, fine-tuning and prompting of LLMs towards desired agentic behaviors.
- **Agent Architectures:** Design and implementation of architectural frameworks that support agency in LLMs, enabling flexibility, scalability, and robustness in various tasks.
- **Human-Agent and Agent-Agent Interaction:** Studies on how LLM agents interact with humans and other agents, including collaboration, feedback, learning, trust, and user experience. Multi-agent systems.
- **Safety and Robustness:** Ensuring the reliability and safety of agentic LLM systems against adversarial scenarios and malicious use.
- **Ethics and Governance:** Frameworks and guidelines for the ethical development, deployment, and oversight of agentic LLM systems.
