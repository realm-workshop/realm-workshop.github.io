[//]: # (Large language models &#40;LLMs&#41; continue to demonstrate strong capabilities with their broad prior knowledge, their ability to process long contexts and often multimodal abilities.)
[//]: # (Unsurprisingly,)
Large language models (LLMs) have become a workhorse to drive intelligent agents to a higher level of agency, autonomy, and self-direction.
As a result, we have witnessed a surge in LLM agents across many diverse environments including web navigation
([WebArena](https://webarena.dev/) and [WorkArena](https://servicenow.github.io/WorkArena/)), mobile applications ([Mobile-Agent](https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent)), protein discovery ([ProtoAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04268)), cybersecurity ([Cybench](https://cybench.github.io/)) and even scientific research ([MLAgentBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03302)).
In addition, integrating various services and more advanced architecture including external tools (e.g. function calling, APIs), memory (e.g. [MemGPT](https://research.memgpt.ai/)), external or private knowledge integration ([RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401), and [RETRO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426)),
advanced planning ([Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), 
[ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/),
[Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366), [self-critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05802), etc.) and multi-agent collaboration into agents has enabled them to accomplish even more complex goals.
Despite these advancements, introducing this level of autonomy and complexity at large scale or in production, brings unprecedented challenges to build, configure, deploy, evaluate, collaborate and improve LLM agents safely and responsibly.

Our workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and thought leaders in the ACL community to discuss and align on the current landscape, key challenges, and future directions of LLM agents.

### Venue

The REALM workshop will take place at the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (**ACL 2025**), in **Vienna, Austria**.
The conference will take place from **July 27th to August 1st, 2025**.
Workshops will be held July 31st and August 1st.
For more details about ACL 2025, check their [website](https://2025.aclweb.org/).
Exact date and room information of the REALM workshop will be announced closer to the event date.
